# Open Chord Voicing

## An application for voicing suggestions

## Introduction
This application is the result of a joint project for our courses Advanced Coding Tools and Methodologies and Computer Music Representation and Models. Our initial motivation was to help piano beginners to add interesting voicings to their chords. Sometimes, a musician doesn't have access to a sheet, but only to the sequence of the chords' names. He might ghen want to look for voicings ideas, or simply for a way to play correctly chords he doesn't know yet. Open Chord Voicing has been designed to build a voicing suggestion for any sequence of chords, and to provide the sheet, the associated audio and the piano keys to be played.
